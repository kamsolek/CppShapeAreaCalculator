# CppShapeAreaCalculator
A C++ project for calculating the areas of various geometric figures, carried out as a programming assignment at college. 
The project uses polymorphism when calling the "oblicz_pole" method. The parent class is declared and the area of the surface figure is calculating by virtual method "oblicz_pole".
An array of 5 objects of the Figure class was declared, various figures with different parameters were added to it and the components of the surface area is calculating in a loop and the sum of all fields is given.
The project uses pointers and dynamic data allocation via the new operator.
